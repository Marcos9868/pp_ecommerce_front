## Introduction:

This is a project of the "Practical Projects" initiative. It is based on a game ecommerce, made with the web base, good practices and a lot of teamwork.

It also features the PC, Playstation and Xbox categories, and both are working perfectly. 

In addition, you can insert these products into the cart and view them in the respective tab.

```bash
#NPM
$ npm install
#YARN
$ yarn or yarn install
```

Compiling new .css file:

```bash
#NPM
$ npm run sass
#YARN
$ yarn sass

## Home Page:

Starting with it, here we have a home with several products, in addition to promotional games, games of the latest in the market.

In addition, we have 3 categories for the games in question: PC, Playstation and Xbox.

## Login Modal:

Here we have a login modal, made in a simple way to simulate the user login.

## Cart and Product Modals:

When you click on the desired game image, it will open a modal with the game description, some images and a button to insert into the cart.



And if you want to open the cart by the button itself, it will display all the games inserted in it.
